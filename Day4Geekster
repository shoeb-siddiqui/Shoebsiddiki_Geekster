integer format.

package Patteriverse;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class pratise {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int a =sc.nextInt();
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		
		if(a>b) {
			System.out.println(a);
		}else {
			System.out.println(b);
		}
			
	}

}


2. Take an integer input and print Even if the integer is even else print Odd.


import java.util.Scanner;

public class pratise {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int a =sc.nextInt();
	
		
		if(a%2==0) {
			System.out.println("even");
		}else {
			System.out.println("odd");
		}
		
	}

}




3. Take income of a person as input from the user, print “No tax to be paid” if income

public class pratise {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int a =sc.nextInt();
		int b = 500000;
	
		
		if(a<b) {
			System.out.println("No tax to be paid");
		}else {
			System.out.println("Tax to be paid");
		}
	
		
	}

		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		System.out.println("enter the marks: ");
		int a = sc.nextInt();
		
		System.out.println("enter the total marks: ");
		int b = sc.nextInt();
		
		System.out.println("Add marks");
		int c = sc.nextInt();
		
		if(a<b) {
			a=a+c;
			System.out.println("The total marks when added four is: " +" " + a);
		}else {
			if(a>b) {
				System.out.println(a);
			}
		}
		
	}

}

    import java.util.Scanner;

public class pratise {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int age = sc.nextInt();
		
		if(age>=70 ) {
			System.out.println("Super senior citizen");
		}else {
			if(age < 70 && age>=59) {
				System.out.println("Senior citizen");
			}else {
				if(age < 59 && age >= 18) {
					System.out.println("Adult");
				}else {
					if(age < 18 && age >= 1) {
						System.out.println("Under age");
					}else {

public class pratise {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int age = sc.nextInt();
		int salary = sc.nextInt();
		
		if(age > 60) {
			salary = salary + 1000;
				System.out.println("Added by 1000: " + " " + salary);
			}else {
				if(age > 40 && age <=60) {
					salary = salary +500;
					System.out.println("Added by 400: " + " " + salary);
				}else {
					if(age <= 40) {
						System.out.println("No money is added to salary " + " " + salary);
					}
				}
		}
